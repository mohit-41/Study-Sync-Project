# Study-Sync-Project
* I have created a responsive website for an ed-tech platfrom named Study Sync.
* It is basically the front-end of the website which is created by using advanced knowledge of HTML and CSS.
* Advanced CSS properties like Media query, Keyframes, Transitions and Grid are used to make this responsive. This website will work for various screen dimensions.
* Here is the screenshot of the website :
